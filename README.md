# thefacebook
A replica of thefacebook.com with very basic functionality. <br/>
I rewrote the backend to work with the newer version of PHP and I changed some of the meta data. The original author of this is: https://github.com/profh <br/>
The original repository for this is: https://github.com/profh/thefacebook <br/><br/>

**How to use** <br/>
1.) Install the latest version of xampp. (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) <br/>
2.) Download this as a zip. <br/>
3.) Extract the zip folder. <br/>
4.) Change xampp's httpd.conf to have the directory of the unzipped folder. <br/>
5.) Start apache and mysql in xampp. <br/>
6.) Go to PHPMyAdmin (http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin). <br/>
7.) Click new in the menu on the left. <br/>
8.) Name the datbase "thefacebook". <br/>
9.) Click create. <br/>
10.) Then click on the database. <br/>
11.) Click import which is in the top bar. <br/>
12.) Click choose file. <br/>
13.) Navigate to and select the file in the facebook directory called "create-database.sql". <br/>

If something doesn't work, feel free to leave a comment or something and I'll try to get back to you. <br/><br/>

**Note** <br/>
Any features that just say "Under Constuction" are features I do not plan to implement. <br/>
I am also aware of the fact that you can't view other profiles and you sometimes get the error of "Please specify a user", If I have time I will fix that.
