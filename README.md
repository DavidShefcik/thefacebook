# thefacebook
A replica of thefacebook.com with very basic functionality.
I rewrote the backend to work with the newer version of PHP and I changed some of the meta data. The original author of this is: https://github.com/profh
The original repository for this is: https://github.com/profh/thefacebook.

**How to use**
1.) Install the latest version of xampp. (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
2.) Download this as a zip.
3.) Extract the zip folder.
4.) Change xampp's httpd.conf to have the directory of the unzipped folder.
5.) Start apache and mysql in xampp.
6.) Go to PHPMyAdmin (http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin).
7.) Click new in the menu on the left.
8.) Name the datbase "thefacebook".
9.) Click create.
10.) Then click on the database/
11.) Click import which is in the top bar.
12.) Click choose file.
13.) Navigate to and select the file in the facebook directory called "create-database.sql".
14.) Click go.
15.) Go to http://127.0.0.1/.

If something doesn't work, feel free to leave a comment or something and I'll try to get back to you.

**Note**
Any features that just say "Under Constuction" are features I do not plan to implement.
I am also aware of the fact that you can't view other profiles and you sometimes get the error of "Please specify a user", If I have time I will fix that.
